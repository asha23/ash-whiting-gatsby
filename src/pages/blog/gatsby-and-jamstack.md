Lately I have been looking into creating sites in a more modular, sensible and maintainable way. This is after nearly a decade of using WordPress to essentially over-engineer everything.

Enter Gatsby. This is a very neat and extensible static website generator, based around React and Graph QL. This website was built in an afternoon, by working through their excellent tutorials.

## Next Steps

Now I've dipped my toes into the water, I can see that this is the future. Here are a few things I want to do.

* Connect this to a WordPress instance and leverage the Rest API to create blogs
* Learn more about GraphQL and create some custom APIs
* Learn more about Gatsby theming
